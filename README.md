# Code-Quiz

To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. 
This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. 
It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
